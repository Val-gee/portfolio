# React Portfolio

## Description

Being a web developer means being part of a large community that love to share their experiences in this career as well as continue their learning. I created this portfolio to share my projects, collaborate with other developers and engineers, and network with potential employeers all in once place. This portfolio provides information about my personal characteristics, a tab with all my projects and their corresponding website and GitHub Links, and a page where you can reach me via email if you'd like to get in touch!

My portfolio is a single-page application using React user interface and is deployed on GitHub through gh-pages.

## Mock-Up

The following screenshot shows the web application's appearance:
