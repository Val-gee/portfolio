                <strong>Hello visitor!</strong> Thank you for taking time to visit my portfolio. I was born in Colombia in the mid 90s and came
                to the sunny beaches of Hollywood, Florida. I dedicated most of my time to school and synchronized
                swimming practice. I was a part of the Aquacades traveling team, that continue to train out of the
                Coral Springs Aquatic Complex, for seven years. Those were some of the best years of my life. I owe
                a lot my teamwork skills and communication to the sport and my teammates. I learned to be
                disciplined and organized at a very young age. I continue to apply those skills as an adult and in
                my professional life. I enjoy helping someone conquer a challenge they are facing or make
                suggestions that might help the effectiveness of a task.
                I moved to New Jersey just before starting high school in 2009. I currently live with my boyfriend,
                Anthony, our poodle Chloe, and our cat Bean. Anthony and I both enjoy outdoor activities and being a
                part of our local Jiu Jitsu community at Radji Barret Jiu Jitsu in Fords. It has been a great
                experience trying something new, aside from learning Web Development! Overall, I like to stay active
                and engage people in communities that share the same mindset: strive to be the best you can be!
